# Dreadball Web Template

A Bootstrap-based HTML5 template for preparing a webapp for Dreadball.

It serves both as a small mockup, giving a general idea of how the application would look, and for preparing the actual theme for the site.

As it is meant just for developing the webapp's UI the project is not accessible online.
